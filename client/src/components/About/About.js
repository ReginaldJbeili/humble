        Welcome to humble. Our goal is to promote community solidarity. We hope
        to help communities become kinder, more supportive and joy-filled. This
        platform has been built to facilitate real-life human interactions that
        are non-transactional in nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        We aim to help communities share their life skills, experience and
        knowledge amongst themselves free of charge, without the exchange of
        money, on a non-commercial basis.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you would like to join our platform, please read and confirm your
        agreement with our statement of intent.
      </p>
